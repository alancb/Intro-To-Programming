- Be able to do math to reach an end goal

# Project #

At MTECH we do not assign grades, instead you have to reach progress thresholds. For the project today you are going to write a program that calculates the users progress in this class. 

How is progress calculated?
Progress is based on the amount of hours completed. In this course everything is based off of 3 hours increments. Every lesson, project, hybrid assignment, book assignment, etc... should take you on average three hours to complete. Obviously some people will go faster or slower, but the hours are there as an average for a student.

An example would be to ask the user how many assignments they have done in each unit. Let's say for example that a student has done all of unit 1 and 4/5 assignments in unit 2. That means the student has 4 units to go and one assignment left.

After finding how many assignments the student has done you need to find out how long they've been in the course. Let's say for example that a student is in their tenth day. 

Using our example student he would be at 90% progress. Your task now is to write a program in python that takes in user information and prints out the result.

There are Six Units, with Five assignments each.
